# object-speed-detection
Matlab code to detect speed of an object in a video

The code takes video as input. Then it is processed and frames are extracted from it. Arbitrarily, two frames are taken and there difference is divided by time to get speed. Moreover, frame/sec units are mapped to cm/sec. GUI is designed to take input and showing output.

1 pixel = 0.4 / 20 cm

1 pixel = 0.02 cm
